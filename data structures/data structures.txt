*Data structure : it's a collection of values, that are stored in a specific way that produces some sort of relation ship between the values, and special functions
and operations that you can apply on them.

*Array (index and value)
+has order
+fast insert and delete at the end
+access element with index (the elements of an array are stored next to each other so it's faster to accesss them)
-slow insert and delete at the beginning
(dynamic arrays, once it needs more memory it will be relocated to another address in memory with more free space)

------------------------------------
*HashTable (key and value)
+fast to search in keys
+fast insert and delete
+access element with key
-unordered

------------------------------------
*LinkedList (Node = {value, pointer to next node})
( Head, Tail, Length )
+has order
+fast insert and delete at the Head
+fast insert at the head
-slow delete at the tail
-can't access element directly, you need to start from the head and traverse node by node
(every element of the linked list is stored in a place in memory, they don't have to be next to each other, so you can add as much as you want without need for 
a memory relecation, unlike dynamic arrays)


--------------------------------------
*Stack
LIFO principle (last in first out)

*Queue
FIFO principle (first in first out)

---------------------------------------
*Trees
nodes related to each other, each node has only one parent, so there is one path only to get from one node to another, tree is nolinear, cause a node can have
multiple shildren so there is multiple paths to choose from.

Root, 
Child, 
Sibling (two nodes that have the same parent), 
Parent, 
Leaf (node without children), 
Edge (connection between two nodes)

**Binary tree
each parent can have 0 or 1 or 2 children only no more.

***Binary search tree
nodes of this tree are sortable you can compare them, every child on the left are less the parent node value, all nodes on the right are greater than the parent node 
so nodes are kept in a specific order.

Insertion O(log(n))
Search O(log(n))

-travesing a tree
Breadth-first search (BFS)
Depth-first Search (DFS)
