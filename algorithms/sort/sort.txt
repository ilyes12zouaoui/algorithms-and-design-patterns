*comparison algorithmes
-insertion sort
-bubble sort
-select sort
-merge sort
-quick sort

*which sorting algorithme to use ?
-Insertion algorithme has a O(n) in best case, so if you have a small array and it's almost sorted this is the best algorithme to use.
-Merge algorithme has a stable O(nlog(n)) complexity in any case, so if you are afraid of the worst case this is the one, but his space complexity is O(n).
